# FrontendReact-FeedbackForm
This is a feedback form done using React. It is implemented on Vscode.<br/>
The user is permitted to upload photos, write a description, fill his name and phone number, and send back the data to the server.
 
## After creating a new directory, use one of the following commands to create your app:
**npm** is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language
```
npm init react-app client
```
OR <br/>
**npx** is an npm package runner that can execute any package that you want from the npm registry without even installing that package.
```
npx create-react-app client
```
Once you run one of these commands, open the project folder:
```
cd client
```
To run the app in development:
```
npm start
```
<br/>
Now, open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
